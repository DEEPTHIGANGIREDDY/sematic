<h2>Here’s The Story Of Rani Lakshmibai, The Queen Who Went To Battle With Her Infant & Two Swords</h2>
<pre>
<arial>The year was <mark>1828</mark> and the place was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi">Varanasi.</a> Moropant Tambe and Bhagirathi Sapre were blessed with a daughter and what they didn’t 
know back then was that she was destined to go down in history as one of the bravest women India has ever known.

They named her ‘<u>Manikarna</u>’ and called her Manu with affection. Soon, however, the name would get lost in the pages of history and their daughter would be 
remembered as ‘Jhansi wali rani’ who went to battle with her infant tied to her back and two swords in both her hands.

<abbr title="Rani Lakshmibai">Manikarna</abbr> lost her mother at the tender age of four and was raised by her father who worked in the court of Peshwa of Bithoor. The Peshwa was very fond of
her and raised Manikarna like his own daughter.

<del>She had a rather unconventional upbringing for a girl</del>. When most girls were being trained to deal with domestic responsibilities and be good wives,
Manikarna was learning horseback riding, fencing and shooting with her childhood friends, <a href="">Nana Sahib and Tatya Tope</a>. In fact, she was also imparted 
education along with her two friends, <blockquote>something that was rare for the women of the time.</blockquote>

In <q>1842, <mark>Manikarna got married to the Maharaja of Jhansi and after her marriage</mark></q>, she came to be known as Rani Lakshmibai. 1851, Lakshmibai became a 
mother after the birth of her son. However, she lost her son after four months. The royal couple eventually adopted Maharaja’s cousin’s son and named 
him Damodar Rao. The adoption, in fact, <ins>happened in front of a British official</ins>.

The then Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, taking advantage of the <mark><u>Maharaja’s death</u></mark>, applied the Doctrine of Lapse. According to this doctrine, 
a king’s adopted child was not entitled to the throne. While the adopted child of the Maharaja could inherit his private property, he would not be 
treated as an heir because they didn’t share a blood relation.
